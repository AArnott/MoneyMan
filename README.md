MoneyMan
========

A financial money management library and applications that utilize it.

## Why?
Because Intuit Quicken has become far too old to work well on modern systems. It suffers from:

1. Poor support for high DPI screens
1. Slow
1. Buggy
1. No competition

Yet Intuit charges $70+ each year for upgrades that add very little value.

MoneyMan is intended to offer users an alternative.

## How?

MoneyMan is primarily implemented in a .NETStandard library, with applications for each platform and device.
It utilizes SQLite as its data store due to its cross-platform availability, compact size and high performance.
